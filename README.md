# Overview
This app aims to fill the gap in MSFS settings by providing the ability to save and swap the graphics settings presets. Might prove particularly useful for users who tend to swap settings depending on their use case e.g. switching between monitors and VR, or between a single monitor for airliners and triples for GA.

# First launch
On the first launch the application will attempt to automatically locate the `UserCfg.opt` file which will serve as the source of the settings saved in each preset. It will also create it's own working directory to store the presets in.
Both of these can be changed at any time.

# How to use
- Adjust the settings in MSFS to your liking
- Open the app
- Enter the desired name for the preset
- Click save
- Repeat as many times as you want
- Swap between the presets by selecting them from the list and clicking `Activate`
